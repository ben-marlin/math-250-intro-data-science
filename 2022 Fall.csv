Guilford College Music Department Performance Studies Syllabus
	Fall 2022, 12 week term
MUS 100 001 – ACCOMPANYING LAB

Instructor: Norris Norwood	
Email: norwoodnm@guilford.edu
Office: Dana 203
Office Hours: By appointment
Classroom: As scheduled with student
Lesson time: As scheduled with student

Prerequisites & Fulfillment of Requirements
•	No prerequisite courses are required for MUS-100-001

Course Description
Accompanying Lab is intended for students majoring or minoring in music, or as an elective course for non-majors. Each semester the curriculum will be designed to fit the appropriate level of the individual taking the course. 

This is an interactive, in-person lab. Students will work weekly on repertoire they are studying in private lessons. Coachings will include a natural progression in the areas of technique, reading, repertoire, performance skills, and musical interpretation. Students should be open and excited about this course of study, and fully engaged in every aspect of learning. 

Student Learning Outcomes

1.	Increase proficiency on instrument—skills in reading, musicality, technical facility and overall musicianship
2.	Develop performance skills, utilizing repertory class as a performance lab—stage presence, and excessive body tension
3.	Increase knowledge of literature
4.	Develop self-confidence, self-discipline, and musical self-expression on a personal level through diligent practice
5.	Voice students will develop and/or refine, as appropriate to the individual’s level of study, the ability to sing in the following languages: English, Italian, French, and/or German
6.	Voice majors will improve translation and pronunciation skills by writing the IPA and translations in the musical scores for all assigned literature

There is no single “curriculum” for private music lessons. While all students (particularly non-majors) who are taking lessons as an elective may have goals that are specific to them personally, the student and teacher will discuss and design a plan to meet individual learning outcomes at the beginning of the semester. Goals and plans will vary from student to student. 

Required Text, Materials & Equipment
Students might be required to purchase sheet music, books, or other equipment throughout the semester. These materials will be indicated by the instructor based on specific student needs and progress. Students must purchase their own copy of music used in lessons and performances in order to comply with copyright law. Additionally, teachers might require a practice journal or log. 

Scheduling the Lesson
Lessons will be scheduled according to each student’s semester class schedule and the instructor’s teaching schedule. Outside commitments are secondary to school.

Practice 
Students are expected to practice daily. The amount of practice time varies according to level, experience, and instrument, but ranges from 30 minutes-3 hours daily. In general, students registered for one credit should practice four hours per week, and students registered for two credits should practice 8 hours per week. Students should plan to engage on a deep level with the ritualistic nature of practicing, and work toward creating an intense bond between their instrument and their lives. Practice is the single most important aspect of improvement for a music student. Each teacher will offer specific practice guidelines that are right for individual students. 

Attendance
Regular and prompt attendance at lessons is mandatory. Students will receive 12 lessons during the semester. Guilford College requires that you miss no more than three classes of a course that meets once per week during the semester. Missing more than three classes can result in you being withdrawn from the course. 

If you must miss your lesson, it is your responsibility to contact the instructor at least 24 hours in advance when possible. Lessons will not be rescheduled unless missed due to documented illness, religious reasons, or a family emergency. Any lesson missed without prior notification past the first absence will result in your semester grade being lowered by a full letter. The instructor will make every effort to schedule a make-up lesson when prior and proper notice is given. 


Rep Class 
All music majors must register for MUS 27X-28X-003 Lab for 0 credit in conjunction with 2 credit lessons. Rep class meeting times are TBA, but will meet weekly during the 12 week term and be led by the following instructor:

Classical Guitar:  Kami Rowan, krowan@guilford.edu
Voice:  Jim Bumgardner jbumgard@guilford.edu
All other instruments:  Drew Hays haysa@guilford.edu

Each absence from Rep class after the 1st will result in a full letter drop for the Performance Studies grade.

*A major’s jury grade will count for 20% of their Performance Studies final grade.



Physical Contact
Non-threatening, and neutral physical contact (for example, moving the student’s wrist, arm, or adjusting posture) is often useful to convey technical information about using the body more effectively to play the instrument or sing. Such occasional contact, when duly respectful of physical and psychological boundaries, is a standard and legitimate part of teaching pedagogy. It is a student’s right and responsibility to inform the teacher if he/she becomes uncomfortable in any way during a lesson.

Course Evaluations
All students will be asked to fill out a course evaluation at the last lesson or before, in accordance with Guilford procedures and guidelines.

*Additional music major information can be found on Information for Music Majors Canvas page. The site includes: an events calendar, policy and procedure documents (how to obtain keys, etc.), jury forms, recital program templates, etc.

Repertoire Requirements for Performance Studies in Voice
Repertoire guidelines apply to both majors and non-majors. Students studying for 2 credits are expected to fulfill, if not surpass, these repertoire guidelines (Students studying for 1 credit are expected to memorize half the amount of repertoire at each given level): 

Freshman: 3-4 songs each semester primarily in English and Italian 
Sophomore: 5-6 songs each semester in English, Italian and either French or German 
Junior: 7-8 songs each semester in English, Italian, French, and German 
Senior: 9-10 songs each semester in English, Italian, French, and German 
*Oratorio and chamber music should be memorized, but may be performed with score. 
*At the discretion of your applied teacher, a student may count literature memorized for other courses towards repertoire requirements.


Academic Honor Code 
Academic honesty and integrity represent central elements of the liberal arts education at Guilford College. As scholars pursuing knowledge and truth, informed by the Quaker testimony on integrity, we seek a community where each member acts responsibly and honorably in all activities and at all times. Acts of dishonesty represent a serious offense at Guilford College. The academic honor code is violated when anyone claims credit, implicitly or explicitly, for work and ideas that are not her or his own. Violations of the academic honor code include, but are not limited to, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and unauthorized use of materials.

Accommodations
Guilford College facilitates and supports the implementation of reasonable accommodations including resources and services for students with documented disabilities, chronic medical conditions, temporary disability, or pregnancy complications resulting in difficulties with accessing learning opportunities. Students requesting academic accommodations must first self-identify and register with the Accessibility Resource Center (ARC) located in Hege Library, Office 217. The Directors will meet with the student to create an individual accommodation plan (IAP). ARC will provide the accommodation letters to instructors at the student’s request when providing any classroom and/or testing accommodations. Please notify ARC the first week of classes to discuss your accommodations needs. More information and relevant policy documents about the types of accommodations and services offered, disability determination, and the student registration process can be found on the Guilford College ARC site.
