II. COURSE DESCRIPTION 

This is an introductory course in Spanish with an emphasis on communication.  We seek to learn and develop all four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  The emphasis is always communication and active interaction.  Grammar will be studied mostly outside of class and practiced in class.  The course is designed to provide the student with the necessary tools to develop a competency sufficient to meet survival needs and some social demands in the target language.  The study of the cultures of Spain and Latin America is an important aspect of the course.  There is a mandatory weekly laboratory session which uses highly interactive software that will improve the student’s ability to communicate in Spanish.  Class is conducted almost exclusively in Spanish.  Class participation is essential.  Three extra-curricular activities related to Hispanic culture are required and two Spanish Coffee Hour sessions are required.

III. STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1.	Speak for basic communication in the target language. (Topics may include: daily activities, immediate needs, preferences.) [The final speaking test will be used for this assessment]
2.	Write simple sentences on familiar, writer-centered topics. [The composition section of the final exam will be used for this assessment]
3.	Recognize and describe fundamental aspects of the target culture(s). [The culture section of the final exam will be used for this assessment.]
IV. CULTURAL ACTIVITIES

You must attend a minimum of three cultural activities related to Spain, Latin America or Latino culture, and two Spanish Coffee Hour sessions (La hora del cafecito) during the semester.  To receive credit for these activities you need to write a one-paragraph commentary in English about each one.  The instructor will announce all activities of which she is aware.

V. LANGUAGE LAB 

The language lab is located in 309 Duke Memorial Hall.  You must enroll in a weekly laboratory session to ensure that you will have a computer available to do the required work.  You must purchase a card at the Guilford College book store that will give you access to the computer program we use.  You are expected to attend the language laboratory for at least one hour each week and to complete the lab assignment for that week before Monday of the following week.  If you miss a lab, you may make it up in the next lab period for which you are scheduled, not during open lab hours or at any other time.

VII. GROUND RULES
	Upon joining this class you are committing to the following:

•	Attendance:  Regular attendance is absolutely necessary for success in this course in order to practice speaking the language; attendance will therefore be taken daily. If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out what you missed so that you come prepared when you return to class.  Attendance is mandatory.  You are allowed three absences for any reason.  Beyond that number of absences, regardless of reason, 2% will be deducted from your final course grade per absence.  Three incidences of tardiness will equal one absence.  After nine absences, you will fail the course.  You are responsible for all assignments and course work done during your absence.  You are also responsible for keeping tab of your absences and knowing when your three allowed absences have been used.  The professor is under no obligation whatsoever to remind you. If you know you will be absent the day an exam is scheduled, it is your responsibility to tell the instructor and arrange to take the exam before the rest of the class. Please note that the instructor has the right to deny the request. A makeup exam will be given only under extreme circumstances and it requires a signed request from your advisor or the Associate Academic Dean.

Note:  An absence the day of a presentation or group project will result in a 0 for that assignment.

•	Class participation:  Class participation means engagement in speaking, listening and responding. You are expected to arrive having read and studied the material, thought about it, and prepared yourself sufficiently to apply the material in classroom activities or to pose questions about it.  The class participation grade will be determined according to the following guidelines:
A = Always volunteers
B = Sometimes volunteers
C = Rarely volunteers, but always answers when called upon
D = Rarely volunteers, but sometimes answers when called upon
F = Never volunteers and never answers when called upon

•	Testing:  There are four quizzes, three unit tests, two speaking tests, and a final exam.  The quizzes, unit tests, and final exam will test grammar and vocabulary as well as reading, writing, and listening skills and the culture that has been covered.  Speaking will be evaluated from class activities (situational role play, presentations, etc) as well as from both oral tests.  There are NO MAKE-UP tests/exams unless arrangements have been made and AUTHORIZED by the instructor PRIOR to the test/exam date or a written excuse is provided immediately upon returning to class and accepted by the instructor.  Also, there are NO MAKE-UP quizzes.  The next quiz will count double if an acceptable written excuse is presented to the instructor immediately upon returning to class.  A grade of zero will be recorded for missed quizzes, tests, exams, and presentations.  Quiz, test, and exam dates are listed in the syllabus.

•	Written work: Written work done during the semester includes compositions and homework assignments (textbook exercises, workbook, Moodle, WEB).   These assignments are due at the BEGINNING OF EACH CLASS and may not be accepted afterward.  Three compositions will be written during class.  Having someone proofread and/or check the grammar, punctuation, etc., of any composition is an Honor Code violation and will be dealt with accordingly.  The workbook exercises are required and must be completed as specified.  Composition and workbook dates are listed on the syllabus.  The textbook’s web site has self-tests (http:www.wiley.com/college/dawson) and geographical, cultural and political information about Spanish-speaking countries (http:www.wiley.com/college/panoramas), both of which are very useful study tools.
•	Time commitment:  Guilford’s Faculty Handbook states that students should expect to spend twelve hours per week for a four-credit class.  That means that students are expected to spend over eight hours per week outside of class in preparation for class discussion and completing assignments for this course.  Please note that this course includes weekly laboratory assignments that must be done in the language lab in Duke 309. Students must complete the appropriate section of the activities manual by the date specified on the syllabus.
•	NO “extra credit” work will be given to improve grades.

•	The academic honor code:  With the purpose of building a community of integrity, all members of this class will be held to the Guilford College academic honor code, which states the following:  “I have been honest and have observed no dishonesty.”  Students will write the statement and sign it at the end of all papers, compositions and exams. Plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration and use of materials are honor code violations as is the use of translators of any kind. 
 
 Academic honesty and integrity represent central elements of the liberal arts education at Guilford College. As scholars pursuing knowledge and truth, informed by the Quaker testimony on integrity, we seek a community where each member acts responsibly and honorably in all activities and at all times.  Acts of dishonesty represent a serious offense at Guilford College. The academic honor code is violated when anyone claims credit, implicitly or explicitly, for work and ideas that are not her or his own. Violations of the academic honor code include, but are not limited to, the list below:

Plagiarism. Guilford defines plagiarism broadly as presenting the interpretations, wording, images, or original conceptions of others as one's own without appropriate acknowledgement. The charge of plagiarism applies to any and all academic work whether done inside or outside of the classroom and whether submitted as a rough draft or a final product.  In this class, we will use MLA style in the format, references and bibliography of all written work.

Unauthorized Collaboration. Students may not combine efforts on any and all academic work, done inside or outside the classroom, submitted to an instructor as a rough draft or a final product, unless specifically permitted by the instructor. When uncertain, the student should seek clarification from the instructor.  

In cases of unauthorized collaboration, any student giving aid is as responsible as the recipient, unless the former is unaware that s/he has provided aid. A student who seeks unauthorized aid is responsible for participating in unauthorized collaboration whether the aid was given or received. The charge of unauthorized collaboration applies to any and all academic work whether done inside or outside of the classroom and whether submitted as a rough draft or a final product.

Unauthorized Use of Materials. It is the student's responsibility to ascertain what materials may be used in any and all academic work whether done inside or outside of the classroom and whether submitted as a rough draft or a final product. The submission for credit of the same written work in more than one course is not permitted without the prior permission of both instructors.

Standard Sanctions for Honor Code Violations:
First offense: F or zero on the assignment.
Second offense: F in the course.
Third offense: F in the course and Suspension or Dismissal from  
      Guilford College.

•	Classroom environment: The classroom environment must be conducive to learning in a relaxed but purposeful manner.  We must be able to concentrate on discussions and the work at hand without disruptions.  For this reason, eating, drinking and chewing gum are not allowed in class.  

Cellular phones and any other equipment must be turned off and placed out of sight during class. Any student using electronic equipment to text, speak with, or in any way communicate with anyone during class time will have his/her final grade reduced by 5% at each occurrence. You will receive a reminder of this policy by email the first time you are seen violating it.  (Sometimes, depending on the activity l will request you bring your laptop to class but restrict your use to applications relevant to classwork.  Should I find you working on something else, I will ask you to leave the classroom and an absence will be counted for that day, as a warning. If you choose to surf other sites not related to class (example facebook, messenger/etc) and this is the second time this occurs you will receive a grade of an F for the class.

Students should drink water and go to the bathroom before class.  Students cannot leave the classroom during an exam, a composition or a quiz and no electronic equipment is allowed unless pre-approved by the instructor.  

•	Behavior:  I expect students to be participative in the class and to take advantage of the material as much as possible. In order to be respectful to other students I ask you to be supportive and to cooperate with those students who might be at a lower or higher level than you are. Students who take over and dominate discussions are generally disruptive and annoying to other students.  For that reason I encourage you to participate in class discussions as much as possible without disrupting the natural pace of the class. 

You must refrain from reading newspapers or material for other classes during class time, as well as having private conversations that are not related to the class discussion with other classmates.

We will always treat each other with dignity, respect and consideration.  

Accommodation for Students with Disabilities and Learning Differences
Guilford complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act by providing a process for disclosing disabilities and arranging for reasonable accommodations. Students who require accommodations must complete a disabilities disclosure and submit it to the Dean for Campus Life. The disability services committee will decide which accommodations are granted, and the student will then meet with the appropriate specialist. It is the student’s choice to disclose difference/disability information to individual instructors. However, only students who provide their instructors with an Accommodations Agreement can receive accommodations. 
Please provide the instructor with the agreement at least one week before the first assignment or test for which you will require accommodations, and s/he will be happy to comply. 

A special note about in-class quizzes/exams and accommodations involving spelling: At times in Spanish, the only distinction between a correct and incorrect answer may be the presence of a single letter or accent. As such, spelling cannot be ignored when it is fundamental to an exercise, e.g. sections of a quiz/exam that specifically test verb conjugations, adjective agreement, article formation, etc. Spelling can only be ignored when it is not fundamental to an exercise, e.g. sections of a quiz/exam that test listening or reading comprehension, etc.


Please see me immediately if you are experiencing problems in the class.  Also feel free to create study groups if this method of study helps you.  Do not fall behind in the course work, as it is almost impossible to catch up in a foreign language class.  Please take advantage of the Spanish tutoring services at the Learning Commons.  My first and most reliable form of contact with you is via e-mail.  Students are required to check their Guilford account daily for necessary information.  I will not address e-mails to any account other than a Guilford account.


                   ASSIGNMENTS

The pages and activities listed are to be read and completed PRIOR to the class meeting for the given dates.  Students are expected to do the assigned listening and speaking exercises in the Language lab (Duke 309)

How to Study a Foreign Language
Research in second language learning has shown that the two most important factors that will contribute to your progress are the motivation to practice and use the language and the time you spend studying, practicing, and using the language. Thus, in the long run your degree of success depends greatly on you.

How to Study a Foreign Language (Adapted from Malia Lemond’s guidelines)

The following suggestions are tried-and-true techniques for learning a second language. Even if you don’t have a special talent for learning languages, you can be successful in Spanish by working at it persistently and strategically. Not all of the suggestions here work for everyone, but you will find some that work for you, and you should try to develop others that will fit your learning style.
1.	Study out loud. To learn a language, you have to study and learn vocabulary and grammar rules. But even more important, you have to listen, speak, imitate, memorize, and practice. When you study out loud, you are creating more ways for the brain to process and store information. Think about learning to ride a bike—the experience of doing it is the most important part of the learning process.
2.	Study every day; organize your study time into small units. To learn a language, you have to keep coming back to the new material until it becomes familiar and automatic, and you can use it without much thought or effort. (That is why what you learned in your first Spanish course probably sticks with you—you have used it more and over a longer time.) So break up your daily study time into chunks of 20-30 minutes. Go over the current material more than once, and review the old material so it stays fresh in your mind.
3.	Study and practice with your friends. When you study for tests or for class with your friends, you end up explaining things to each other. This is one of the best ways to learn. Also, by practicing and studying out loud with your friends, you will be helping yourself acquire the sounds and structure of the language.
4.	Don’t fall behind. Class meets only three days a week, and the pace is fast. If you fall behind, you may soon be so far behind that you will not be able to catch up. Take the time you need every day to feel like you both understand and can use the current material. 
5.	Review, review, review. In the long run, the learning process boils down to a constant process of learning, forgetting some of it, relearning, forgetting a bit less, relearning again... until the material becomes so much a part of you that you can use it easily. Rather than skim along for weeks and then try to cram for tests, you will learn much more (and much better) if you incorporate reviewing old material into your study schedule.
6.	Come to every class session. Class is where you speak Spanish and hear it spoken, and I prepare activities that are not in the book and, therefore, that cannot be made up. [This is the main reason for the attendance requirement in Spanish.] If you come to class unprepared, tell me as you arrive. It is more respectful of me and your classmates to be up-front about it. 
7.	Think about what you are learning. Language is a system. You will not be able to understand the whole picture right away, but as you study, look for connections between words, verb tenses, etc. If you are able to see the systematic nature of what you are learning, this will help you to retain the information better. It is a lot harder to learn a series of unconnected facts or items than to learn facts or items that are part of a system. 
8.	Ask for help. I am here to help you. Take advantage of my office hours; ask questions.

COURSE DESCRIPTION: Spanish 201 is a first semester intermediate language course conducted in Spanish.  It stresses oral expression, reading, writing and listening while providing an intensive grammar review.  Cultural and literary readings are used to expand vocabulary, stimulate discussion, and broaden understanding of the Hispanic world.





















Texts:

E. Spinelli, C. García, C. E. Galvin Flood. Interacciones. 7th ed. Heinle Cingage Learning. 2013
Workbook: Spinelli. Interacciones. 7th ed. 9781111829971

REQUIREMENTS:
Prepare for class each day by looking ahead at the grammar, vocabulary, activities, readings and cultural notes in the chapter.
Homework is centered on the Text book and materials the instructor will assign.
Homework will be turned in to the instructor at the beginning of class on the due date. Late homework will not be accepted. Assignments will be graded on evident effort, legibility, self-correction, and over-all quality of written work.
Instructor will assign additional homework such as compositions, grammar exercises or web related work.
PLEASE NOTE:  Not All homework will be collected. It is up to the instructor to decide which assignments will count toward your final grade. Therefore, you need to maintain the same quality standards for all your assignments even if they may not be collected.
NO ‘extra credit’ work will be given to improve grades.
Attendance Policy:
Attendance:  The Department of Foreign Languages unanimously implements an attendance policy which is accordingly stated and enforced:  “Students are allowed three total absences during the semester without penalty.  Each subsequent absence will result in a 2% reduction of the student’s final grade.  The three absences cover occurrences such as but not limited to illness, death in the family, sleeping in, emergencies, or an official Guilford College event in which the student is a participant.  More than 10 minutes late is a tardy. Tardiness will be penalized. More than 10 minutes is considered an absence. Students are responsible for the material covered and the homework assigned on the day/s they are absent.
Please see me immediately if you are experiencing problems in the class.  Also feel free to create study groups if this method of study helps you.  

Note:  Although the aforementioned absence policy covers both excused and unexcused absences, any written work missed due to an unexcused absence still counts as zero. 
Time commitment:  Guilford’s Faculty Handbook states that students should expect to spend twelve hours per week for a four-credit class.  That means that since students spend 3.75 hours per week in class, they are expected to spend a minimum of 8.25 hours per week outside of class in preparation for class discussion and completing assignments for this course. These include daily study of the assigned material and written assignments, completion of the exercise workbook and laboratory workbook, preparation for skits, quizzes, tests and class presentations, as well as attendance to a cultural activities per semester.  These activities must include a written one-page commentary in order to receive credit. 

Guilford complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act by providing a process for disclosing disabilities and arranging for reasonable accommodations. The policy can be found online at: http://www.guilford.edu/about_guilford/services_and_administration/lc/disability/ada.html. Students who require accommodations must complete a disabilities disclosure form and submit it to the Dean for Campus life. The disability services committee will decide which accommodations are granted, and the student will then meet with the appropriate specialist. It is the student’s choice to disclose difference/disability information to individual instructors. However, only students who provide their instructors with an Accommodations Agreement can receive accommodations. Students must provide documentation by the second week of class.

Behavior: The Guilford College Student Handbook states the following:  Members of the Guilford community are expected to treat one another and themselves with dignity and respect. Guilford’s policies and procedures embody and enforce commonly held community values, many of which relate to respect for persons, the community, property, health and safety. One of the objectives of a liberal arts education is the ability to imagine your way into the lives of people whose lives are distinctively different from your own. To imagine yourself into the lives of those of a different race, religion, age or sexual orientation is to begin to understand how inappropriate certain statements or pranks can be, whether or not the speaker intended or is capable of actual harm. The judicial process not only educates the accused and deters his or her future violations, but it also protects the general health, safety, morale, rights and well being of all members of the greater Guilford community.

The academic honor code:  With the purpose of building a community of integrity, all members of this class will be held to the Guilford College academic honor code, which states the following:  “I have been honest and have observed no dishonesty.”  Students will write the statement and sign it at the end of all papers and exams. Plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration and use of materials are honor code violations as is the use of translators of any kind. 
After 5 undocumented absences you will receive an automatic F in the course
Attendance means attentiveness, cooperation, and active participation in class. Do contact me about your absences.
Grading:
Exams:	40%
Oral Presentations:	15%
Homework:	15%
Quizzes (Written and Oral):	15%
Participation/ Attendance:	15%

There will be 3 unit tests as indicated on the syllabus. They will include listening comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing. 
Students will be tested on the oral production of vocabulary, phrases, dialogues as well as appropriateness of use of forms in a given context in the form of oral quizzes.
Students will make oral presentations. These will be approximately 8 minute long with a 2 minute question and answer section. The topic will be chosen in consultation with the instructor. Presentations cannot be read. Students absent the day of the presentation will receive a zero unless previously discussed and authorized by the instructor.
Cell phones: Disconnected and not visible at all times during class time or tests. No text messaging is allowed during class time. 10% of the final grade deducted should a student text during class. The same rule applies if you answer a phone call during class time. 

Restroom: Go to the restroom or drink water before or after class. 
Tests/Exams: if for some reason you decide to leave the classroom during a test/quiz/exam you must turn in your exam/quiz at that moment. You will be graded up to that point. You will not be able to resume working on your paper upon returning to the classroom.

Technology: The use of cell phones and other electronic devices is not allowed in the classroom. 

Compositions: There will be assigned through the semester. These compositions are part of your homework. Copying or translating an article from Wikipedia constitutes a violation of the honor system, even if cited. A very close translation of a Wikipedia article also constitutes a violation of the honor system. 
Agr: Agreement (noun-adjective or subject-verb). 
WW: wrong word, e.g. por for para.
WT: Wrong tense, e.g. imperfect for preterit. 
WO: Word order
SP: Spelling, e.g. pero for perro. 
Reflex: Reflexive pronoun missing
MW: Missing word, e.g. fin (de) semana missing de.  

Final Exam:
There will be a cumulative final exam (100 points) that will be held during the Final Exam Week (Tuesday May 14th, 8:30-11:00 a.m.). 
Students with a total average of A (see grading scale below) will be exempt from the final exam.
Grading Scale:
94-100% A	77-79% C+
90-93% A-	73-76% C
87-89% B+	70-72% C-
83-86% B	69-65% D
80-82% B-	64 and lower F
The grade of incomplete will be given only to students who for some documented reason have been unable to complete the course requirements and have at least a passing grade up to the point where they could not complete the requirements.
Incomplete grades must be approved by the Associate Academic Dean.
IMPORTANT: If you begin to experience inordinate difficulty with the class, or have issues regarding the class that you want to discuss, please let the instructor know as soon as possible. If you wait until the end of the semester the possibilities of being helped are less promising.
Email: Use proper grammar and capitalization and punctuation, and proofread before you hit send.
• Address your instructor respectfully, and be polite and understanding of the fact that they are very busy. (Dear Dr…./Dear Professor) • Be specific about what exactly you need from them; and a little flattery about their class or the readings or something never hurts. • Thank them in advance for their help.
Note: Dates indicated on the syllabus are subject to change.

Attendance Policy:
Attendance:  The Department of Foreign Languages unanimously implements an attendance policy which is accordingly stated and enforced:  “Students are allowed three total absences during the semester without penalty.  Each subsequent absence will result in a 2% reduction of the student’s final grade.  The three absences cover occurrences such as but not limited to illness, death in the family, sleeping in, emergencies, or an official Guilford College event in which the student is a participant.  More than 10 minutes late is a tardy. Tardiness will be penalized. More than 10 minutes is considered an absence. Students are responsible for the material covered and the homework assigned on the day/s they are absent.
Please see me immediately if you are experiencing problems in the class.  Also feel free to create study groups if this method of study helps you.  

Note:  Although the aforementioned absence policy covers both excused and unexcused absences, any written work missed due to an unexcused absence still counts as zero. For each absence beyond the 3 allowed your final grade will drop one letter grade. 

Time commitment:  Guilford’s Faculty Handbook states that students should expect to spend twelve hours per week for a four-credit class.  That means that since students spend 3.75 hours per week in class, they are expected to spend a minimum of 8.25 hours per week outside of class in preparation for class discussion and completing assignments for this course. 

Guilford complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act by providing a process for disclosing disabilities and arranging for reasonable accommodations. The policy can be found online at: http://www.guilford.edu/about_guilford/services_and_administration/lc/disability/ada.html. Students who require accommodations must complete a disabilities disclosure form and submit it to the Dean for Campus life. The disability services committee will decide which accommodations are granted, and the student will then meet with the appropriate specialist. It is the student’s choice to disclose difference/disability information to individual instructors. However, only students who provide their instructors with an Accommodations Agreement can receive accommodations. Students must provide documentation by the second week of class.

Behavior: The Guilford College Student Handbook states the following:  Members of the Guilford community are expected to treat one another and themselves with dignity and respect. Guilford’s policies and procedures embody and enforce commonly held community values, many of which relate to respect for persons, the community, property, health and safety. One of the objectives of a liberal arts education is the ability to imagine your way into the lives of people whose lives are distinctively different from your own. To imagine yourself into the lives of those of a different race, religion, age or sexual orientation is to begin to understand how inappropriate certain statements or pranks can be, whether or not the speaker intended or is capable of actual harm. The judicial process not only educates the accused and deters his or her future violations, but it also protects the general health, safety, morale, rights and well being of all members of the greater Guilford community.

The academic honor code:  With the purpose of building a community of integrity, all members of this class will be held to the Guilford College academic honor code, which states the following:  “I have been honest and have observed no dishonesty.”  Students will write the statement and sign it at the end of all papers and exams. Plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration and use of materials are honor code violations as is the use of translators of any kind. 
After 5 undocumented absences you will receive an automatic F in the course
Attendance means attentiveness, cooperation, and active participation in class. Do contact me about your absences. 
Participation & Attendance Grading Rubrics
Level of Participation and preparation	
Uses only Spanish when possible; exhibits excellent, cooperative behavior; always comes to class prepared.	10
Uses Spanish often; exhibits good, cooperative behavior, usually prepared for class	8
Uses Spanish and exhibits good, cooperative behavior sometimes; adequate preparation	6
Frequent use of English, average participation, adequate preparation.	4
Uses more English than Spanish, minimal participation, unprepared.	2
Does not participate	0

B.   Student Conduct and Academic Integrity: Student conduct is viewed as a serious matter by the faculty members of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures.  The faculty members assume that all students will conduct themselves as mature citizens of the campus community and will conduct themselves in a manner congruent with university policies and regulations.  Students who exhibit disruptive behavior or show disrespect to a teacher in the classroom are subject to severe disciplinary sanctions. 
Likewise, academic honesty is expected of all students in the department, in accordance with university policy.  There are established university reporting procedures if a student is suspected of committing an academically dishonest act (cheating, plagiarism, etc).  Any attempt to hand in work not done by yourself will receive a zero (0).

Rúbrica para la evaluación de composiciones
Ideas
30-27	Excelente – Muy bien	Tesis interesante y clara. Un ensayo bien pensado con una tesis clara y bien desarrollada. Incluye detalles específicos y bien seleccionados que apoyan la tesis.
26-22	Bueno -- Adecuado	Ideas interesantes, en general, pero podría explorar más profundamente el tema. Desarrollo adecuado, aunque algunas ideas pueden estar mal apoyadas o no tienen una relación clara con la tesis.
21-17	Más o menos – Le falta	Tesis poco clara, o que no presenta una opinión o idea debatible. El tema ha sido explorado sólo superficialmente y desarrollado a medias, con muchas ideas sin apoyo o irrelevantes.
16-13	Necesita mucho trabajo	Ideas superficiales y/o no interesantes, con poco desarrollo. O no hay suficiente material para poder evaluar el texto.
 
Organización
20-18	Excelente – Muy bien	La información se presenta de manera lógica y clara. Todos los párrafos están bien estructurados, con una oración temática que introduce una idea y que se desarrolla dentro del párrafo. Todas las ideas están vinculadas a la tesis.
17-14	Buena -- Adecuada	Los párrafos están bien estructurados y en general presentan ideas que están vinculadas a la tesis. La secuencia de ideas no queda clara a veces y puede parecer desconectada. Las transiciones son a veces bruscas. El lector puede tener algunas dificultades en seguir la corriente de ideas.
13-10	Más o menos – Le falta	Ideas confusas o incongruentes. Algunos párrafos mal estructurados, sin oraciones temáticas o con varias ideas mezcladas. Con frecuencia, es difícil comprender la conexión con la tesis y el mensaje que se trata de comunicar.
9-7	Necesita mucho trabajo	Organización lógica inexistente. Una “ensalada” de ideas. O no hay suficiente material para poder evaluar el texto.
 
Gramática
25-22	Excelente – Muy bien	Una amplia variedad de estructuras, con pocos errores que no dificultan la comprensión.

CULTURA Y CIVILIZACIÓN LATINOAMERICANA
Examen Final                                               Nombre: ____________________________
Dr. Rinaldi 
Conteste TRES (3) de las siguientes preguntas en forma de ensayo. Dé ejemplos concretos de las lecturas del libro de texto:
 
1.	Explique la influencia de la Teología de la Liberación y de la pedagogía del oprimido de Paulo Freire en Latinoamérica. Si puede, comente los conceptos de “miedo a la libertad” y “concientización” en el discurso de Paulo Freire, así como la siguiente frase: “El gran problema radica en cómo podrán los oprimidos, como seres duales, inauténticos, que ‘alojan’ al opresor en sí, participar de la elaboración, de la pedagogía para su liberación” (226).
 
2.	Analice el impacto del neoliberalismo y la globalización en Latinoamérica. Explique también la siguiente frase de Mario “Pacho” O’Donnel: “Lo positivo del drama argentino es que muestra descarnadamente los peores efectos de la globalización ideologizada por el fundamentalismo neoliberal, la ‘globalización’ depredadora.” (360).
 
3.	Comente el análisis que hace Octavio Paz en “Los hijos de la Malinche” de la identidad nacional y de las expresiones populares mexicanas. Explique la siguiente afirmación: “Toda la angustiosa tensión que nos habita se expresa en una frase que viene a la boca cuando la cólera, la alegría o el entusiasmo nos llevan a exaltar nuestra condición de mexicanos: ¡Viva México, hijos de la Chingada!” (349). 
 
4.	Comente la integración de “Las Marías” a la vida urbana y las contradicciones que existen en el texto de Lourdes Arizpe. Por ejemplo, por una parte dice del indígena que “El vivir en su grupo étnico… les cierra las puertas a ciertas ocupaciones”, pero por otra afirma que el mercado de trabajo está tan saturado que no entran en juego cuestiones de etnicidad. Explique, asimismo, el siguiente pasaje: ¡Es de vital importancia comprender este hecho, ya que refuta por completo la noción de que integrando culturalmente a las ‘Marías’ se resolverá su miseria” (159).
 
5.	Explique qué organizaciones o grupos aparecen en el libro de texto que se dediquen a ayudar al desarrollo de las comunidades indígenas de Latinoamérica. Comente, por ejemplo, los usos que se dan al “sociodrama” según “La Feria Educativa” y las reacciones que tuvieron los indígenas.  Explique, también, por qué las comunidades indígenas rechazan a algunos educadores y aceptan a otros.
