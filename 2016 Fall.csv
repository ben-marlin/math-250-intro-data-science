From goals identified by the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS: www.hapsweb.org)
1. Recognize/identify anatomical structures and how they contribute to physiological function (the interrelationship of structure and function)
2. Explain the principle of homeostasis and feedback loops using numerous examples from human physiology.
3. Use appropriate terminology to communicate information related to anatomy and physiology. 
4. Synthesize and apply concepts of A&P to real-world situations (disease, life-style choices, homeostatic imbalances). 
5. Demonstrate laboratory procedures used to examine anatomical structures and physiological functions of the human body. 
6. Interpret graphs of physiological function.
7. Examine issues related to A&P from evidence-based perspective.
8. Effectively communicate knowledge/understanding of the human body to different audiences and applications.
