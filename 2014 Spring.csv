Guilford College Five Academic Principles
This class encourages innovative student-centered learning by emphasizing class discussion,
requiring individual and group presentations, and by relating the content and principles to
students’ personal experiences. It provides a challenge to engage in critical and creative
thinking by requiring students to analyze real nonprofit organizations and by encouraging them
to develop and support their own lines of reasoning by decoding Requests for Proposals (RFP’s)
for fundraising. The class will address the importance of global or international program and
grant collaboration and diverse cultural perspectives of how funding for nonprofit organizations
is distributed. One of the predominant themes of the course is how granting agencies and
foundations promote their missions and how funding decisions reflect organizational values, as
well as how they relate to justice, and how sometimes those values and can change over time.
Ethics and social responsibility of nonprofit organizations are recurring themes, as well as
specific topics within the course. This class emphasizes practical applications because most of
the concepts are relevant to the everyday life of each of us, and students are required to make
these practical connections throughout the course.
Course Learning Outcomes/Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of the key differences between the non-profit, for-profit and
public sectors, non-profit governance, operations, and fiscal aspects of non-profit organizations.
2. Articulate the different financial planning challenges facing non-profits, compared to the for profit 
sector.
3. Demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of various types of fundraising.
4. Demonstrate an understanding of the various types of fundraising campaigns and choose the
most appropriate one to implement.
5. Demonstrate an understanding of endowments and special funds.
6. Demonstrate understanding of handling/processing grants.
7. Demonstrate an understanding of fund accounting and bylaws."

Grading   (You will be provided a website to view your performance) 

This class is a credit/no credit class.  Therefore, a student does not receive a grade on the official college transcript, but rather earns or does not earn credit for the course.  In order to earn the two credits, a student must:

•	Pass the final exam/Quantitative Literacy Test 
•	Earn 80% of the possible points recorded for exercises and assignments 
•	Not miss more than four class sessions 


Work handed in should be clearly labeled.  For the mathematical assignments, the students should hand in their work by Exercise Set.  Be sure to include your work as well as your thoughts.  Also, the final answers should be circled or highlighted in some visible manner.  Work can be made up and resubmitted for grading.  Students should expect to hand in all work as scheduled.  While each student may work at his/her own pace, there will be a scheduled time for completed work to be passed in to ensure that students are moving forward.

Students are expected to initially attempt to work each problem on their own.  Getting stuck and figuring out how to get unstuck is part of the learning process we each go through.  Students may certainly seek help, but it is important that you do not confuse getting the correct answers with knowing and understanding the material.  In this course, it is strongly recommended that you focus on becoming more skilled and getting a better understanding of how to do the problems, rather than merely getting the correct answers.
