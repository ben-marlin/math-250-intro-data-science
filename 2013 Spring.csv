Students should gain a working understanding of the following objectives:
1. Major environmental issues affecting society including Climate Change; Depletion of Natural Resources (Energy, Fish, Ecosystem Services, Soil, and Clean Water); Pollution with toxic chemicals; Ecological disruption from introduced Species and conversion of habitats; and extirpation or extinction of sensitive species.
2. The Tragedy of the Commons and Economic Externalities are fundamental concepts for understanding the ultimate causes of many environmental issues.
3. Environmental Studies require a holistic approach to problem solving taking into account aspects of science, social sciences, communication, and other disciplines.
4. Environmental studies is an applied science, and students will gain experience asking  careful questions, explaining problems clearly and convincingly, evaluating data objectively, and working directly on solutions to the problems identified.
5. Environmental studies require the use of physical models of how environmental systems will respond to perturbations. The models have explicit assumptions and are tested by how well they can model historical conditions.  Finally, models are constantly tested, revised, and improved as new methods are developed.
6. Environmental scientists must use caution when making projections. They should attempt to avoid overly optimistic or pessimistic scenarios and allowing for and anticipating future innovations. Such innovations, particularly over the long term, can alter responses of environments, reducing some impacts and making other impacts more troublesome than expected.
7. Environmental studies use creative techniques to reconstruct past environments and understand how those systems changed over time with the highest precision possible. We will examine some of the tools used to study interactions that took place both before and after humans developed written languages.
8. We will invite guest instructors to participate in our discussions and to provide an opportunity for you to meet other faculty at Guilford College who teach in the Environmental Studies discipline.

COURSE DESCRIPTION: Spanish 201 is a first semester intermediate language course conducted in Spanish.  It stresses oral expression, reading, writing and listening while providing an intensive grammar review.  Cultural and literary readings are used to expand vocabulary, stimulate discussion, and broaden understanding of the Hispanic world.





















Texts:

E. Spinelli, C. García, C. E. Galvin Flood. Interacciones. 7th ed. Heinle Cingage Learning. 2013
Workbook: Spinelli. Interacciones. 7th ed. 9781111829971

REQUIREMENTS:
Prepare for class each day by looking ahead at the grammar, vocabulary, activities, readings and cultural notes in the chapter.
Homework is centered on the Text book and materials the instructor will assign.
Homework will be turned in to the instructor at the beginning of class on the due date. Late homework will not be accepted. Assignments will be graded on evident effort, legibility, self-correction, and over-all quality of written work.
Instructor will assign additional homework such as compositions, grammar exercises or web related work.
PLEASE NOTE:  Not All homework will be collected. It is up to the instructor to decide which assignments will count toward your final grade. Therefore, you need to maintain the same quality standards for all your assignments even if they may not be collected.
NO ‘extra credit’ work will be given to improve grades.
Attendance Policy:
Attendance:  The Department of Foreign Languages unanimously implements an attendance policy which is accordingly stated and enforced:  “Students are allowed three total absences during the semester without penalty.  Each subsequent absence will result in a 2% reduction of the student’s final grade.  The three absences cover occurrences such as but not limited to illness, death in the family, sleeping in, emergencies, or an official Guilford College event in which the student is a participant.  More than 10 minutes late is a tardy. Tardiness will be penalized. More than 10 minutes is considered an absence. Students are responsible for the material covered and the homework assigned on the day/s they are absent.
Please see me immediately if you are experiencing problems in the class.  Also feel free to create study groups if this method of study helps you.  

Note:  Although the aforementioned absence policy covers both excused and unexcused absences, any written work missed due to an unexcused absence still counts as zero. 
Time commitment:  Guilford’s Faculty Handbook states that students should expect to spend twelve hours per week for a four-credit class.  That means that since students spend 3.75 hours per week in class, they are expected to spend a minimum of 8.25 hours per week outside of class in preparation for class discussion and completing assignments for this course. These include daily study of the assigned material and written assignments, completion of the exercise workbook and laboratory workbook, preparation for skits, quizzes, tests and class presentations, as well as attendance to a cultural activities per semester.  These activities must include a written one-page commentary in order to receive credit. 

Guilford complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act by providing a process for disclosing disabilities and arranging for reasonable accommodations. The policy can be found online at: http://www.guilford.edu/about_guilford/services_and_administration/lc/disability/ada.html. Students who require accommodations must complete a disabilities disclosure form and submit it to the Dean for Campus life. The disability services committee will decide which accommodations are granted, and the student will then meet with the appropriate specialist. It is the student’s choice to disclose difference/disability information to individual instructors. However, only students who provide their instructors with an Accommodations Agreement can receive accommodations. Students must provide documentation by the second week of class.

Behavior: The Guilford College Student Handbook states the following:  Members of the Guilford community are expected to treat one another and themselves with dignity and respect. Guilford’s policies and procedures embody and enforce commonly held community values, many of which relate to respect for persons, the community, property, health and safety. One of the objectives of a liberal arts education is the ability to imagine your way into the lives of people whose lives are distinctively different from your own. To imagine yourself into the lives of those of a different race, religion, age or sexual orientation is to begin to understand how inappropriate certain statements or pranks can be, whether or not the speaker intended or is capable of actual harm. The judicial process not only educates the accused and deters his or her future violations, but it also protects the general health, safety, morale, rights and well being of all members of the greater Guilford community.

The academic honor code:  With the purpose of building a community of integrity, all members of this class will be held to the Guilford College academic honor code, which states the following:  “I have been honest and have observed no dishonesty.”  Students will write the statement and sign it at the end of all papers and exams. Plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration and use of materials are honor code violations as is the use of translators of any kind. 
After 5 undocumented absences you will receive an automatic F in the course
Attendance means attentiveness, cooperation, and active participation in class. Do contact me about your absences.
Grading:
Exams:	40%
Oral Presentations:	15%
Homework:	15%
Quizzes (Written and Oral):	15%
Participation/ Attendance:	15%

There will be 3 unit tests as indicated on the syllabus. They will include listening comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing. 
Students will be tested on the oral production of vocabulary, phrases, dialogues as well as appropriateness of use of forms in a given context in the form of oral quizzes.
Students will make oral presentations. These will be approximately 8 minute long with a 2 minute question and answer section. The topic will be chosen in consultation with the instructor. Presentations cannot be read. Students absent the day of the presentation will receive a zero unless previously discussed and authorized by the instructor.
Cell phones: Disconnected and not visible at all times during class time or tests. No text messaging is allowed during class time. 10% of the final grade deducted should a student text during class. The same rule applies if you answer a phone call during class time. 

Restroom: Go to the restroom or drink water before or after class. 
Tests/Exams: if for some reason you decide to leave the classroom during a test/quiz/exam you must turn in your exam/quiz at that moment. You will be graded up to that point. You will not be able to resume working on your paper upon returning to the classroom.

Technology: The use of cell phones and other electronic devices is not allowed in the classroom. 

Compositions: There will be assigned through the semester. These compositions are part of your homework. Copying or translating an article from Wikipedia constitutes a violation of the honor system, even if cited. A very close translation of a Wikipedia article also constitutes a violation of the honor system. 
Agr: Agreement (noun-adjective or subject-verb). 
WW: wrong word, e.g. por for para.
WT: Wrong tense, e.g. imperfect for preterit. 
WO: Word order
SP: Spelling, e.g. pero for perro. 
Reflex: Reflexive pronoun missing
MW: Missing word, e.g. fin (de) semana missing de.  

Final Exam:
There will be a cumulative final exam (100 points) that will be held during the Final Exam Week (Tuesday May 14th, 8:30-11:00 a.m.). 
Students with a total average of A (see grading scale below) will be exempt from the final exam.
Grading Scale:
94-100% A	77-79% C+
90-93% A-	73-76% C
87-89% B+	70-72% C-
83-86% B	69-65% D
80-82% B-	64 and lower F
The grade of incomplete will be given only to students who for some documented reason have been unable to complete the course requirements and have at least a passing grade up to the point where they could not complete the requirements.
Incomplete grades must be approved by the Associate Academic Dean.
IMPORTANT: If you begin to experience inordinate difficulty with the class, or have issues regarding the class that you want to discuss, please let the instructor know as soon as possible. If you wait until the end of the semester the possibilities of being helped are less promising.
Email: Use proper grammar and capitalization and punctuation, and proofread before you hit send.
• Address your instructor respectfully, and be polite and understanding of the fact that they are very busy. (Dear Dr…./Dear Professor) • Be specific about what exactly you need from them; and a little flattery about their class or the readings or something never hurts. • Thank them in advance for their help.
Note: Dates indicated on the syllabus are subject to change.

Class is conducted in Spanish.  Class participation is essential. 

Qué esperar de la clase: Objetivos
It is essential to your success that you use class time to practice speaking Spanish as much as possible. 
Ask questions if things are not clear, but remember that it is also important that you guess from the context (which is one of the best strategies to learn a foreign language). Even if you cannot remember a certain word in Spanish, try paraphrasing, or explaining things in a different way, while communicating the same ideas.  The time you spend in class is only sufficient to introduce new material, but not enough in order to master it. At the very minimum, you should be prepared to spend two hours of study for every hour of class (plus the time required for completing homework and preparing for an exam/quiz). Please be patient with yourself. Learning another language takes patience, hard work, and a sense of humor when dealing with yourself and with others. 

Learning outcomes:  At the end of this course you will:

 * Understand the historical events behind certain situations/conditions and how they affect not only literature, but also social and political structures
* Start to form associations relating differences and similarities between Mexico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Central America.
* Read with critical depth the literary selections studied in this class while taking diverse viewpoints into account
* Further your speaking abilities through class discussions 
*  Write critically about selected topics


REQUIREMENTS:
Homework is centered on the readings and materials the instructor will assign.
Homework will be turned in to the instructor at the beginning of class on the due date. Late homework will not be accepted. Assignments will be graded on evident effort, legibility, self-correction, and over-all quality of written work.
Instructor will assign additional homework such as compositions, grammar exercises or web related work.
PLEASE NOTE:  Not All homework will be collected. It is up to the instructor to decide which assignments will count toward your final grade. Therefore, you need to maintain the same quality standards for all your assignments even if they may not be collected.
NO ‘extra credit’ work will be given to improve grades.
Attendance Policy:
Attendance:  The Department of Foreign Languages unanimously implements an attendance policy which is accordingly stated and enforced:  “Students are allowed three total absences during the semester without penalty.  Each subsequent absence will result in a 2% reduction of the student’s final grade.  The three absences cover occurrences such as but not limited to illness, death in the family, sleeping in, emergencies, or an official Guilford College event in which the student is a participant.  More than 10 minutes late is a tardy. Tardiness will be penalized. More than 10 minutes is considered an absence. Students are responsible for the material covered and the homework assigned on the day/s they are absent.
Please see me immediately if you are experiencing problems in the class.  Also feel free to create study groups if this method of study helps you.  

Note:  Although the aforementioned absence policy covers both excused and unexcused absences, any written work missed due to an unexcused absence still counts as zero. For each absence beyond the 3 allowed your final grade will drop one letter grade. 

Time commitment:  Guilford’s Faculty Handbook states that students should expect to spend twelve hours per week for a four-credit class.  That means that since students spend 3.75 hours per week in class, they are expected to spend a minimum of 8.25 hours per week outside of class in preparation for class discussion and completing assignments for this course. 

Guilford complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act by providing a process for disclosing disabilities and arranging for reasonable accommodations. The policy can be found online at: http://www.guilford.edu/about_guilford/services_and_administration/lc/disability/ada.html. Students who require accommodations must complete a disabilities disclosure form and submit it to the Dean for Campus life. The disability services committee will decide which accommodations are granted, and the student will then meet with the appropriate specialist. It is the student’s choice to disclose difference/disability information to individual instructors. However, only students who provide their instructors with an Accommodations Agreement can receive accommodations. Students must provide documentation by the second week of class.

Behavior: The Guilford College Student Handbook states the following:  Members of the Guilford community are expected to treat one another and themselves with dignity and respect. Guilford’s policies and procedures embody and enforce commonly held community values, many of which relate to respect for persons, the community, property, health and safety. One of the objectives of a liberal arts education is the ability to imagine your way into the lives of people whose lives are distinctively different from your own. To imagine yourself into the lives of those of a different race, religion, age or sexual orientation is to begin to understand how inappropriate certain statements or pranks can be, whether or not the speaker intended or is capable of actual harm. The judicial process not only educates the accused and deters his or her future violations, but it also protects the general health, safety, morale, rights and well being of all members of the greater Guilford community.

The academic honor code:  With the purpose of building a community of integrity, all members of this class will be held to the Guilford College academic honor code, which states the following:  “I have been honest and have observed no dishonesty.”  Students will write the statement and sign it at the end of all papers and exams. Plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration and use of materials are honor code violations as is the use of translators of any kind. 
After 5 undocumented absences you will receive an automatic F in the course
Attendance means attentiveness, cooperation, and active participation in class. Do contact me about your absences.
